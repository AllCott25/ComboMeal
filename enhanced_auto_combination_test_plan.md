# Enhanced Auto Combination Test Plan

## Basic Functionality Tests

1. **Full Sequence Test**
   - Play through a recipe until only the final recipe components remain
   - Verify the complete auto-combination sequence runs correctly:
     - Initial delay occurs before sequence starts
     - All final vessels shake simultaneously
     - All vessels move to center point simultaneously
     - Final combination occurs with particle effects
     - Final verb animation displays properly
     - Game transitions to win screen

2. **State Machine Transition Test**
   - Use console logging to verify proper state transitions:
     - WAITING → PENULTIMATE → SHAKE → MOVE → COMBINING → COMPLETED
   - Confirm each state executes its intended actions
   - Verify state only advances when previous actions are complete

3. **Animation Timing Test**
   - Verify proper timing for each phase:
     - Initial delay (1 second)
     - Shake animation (0.5 seconds)
     - Movement to center (1 second)
     - Final combination with particles
     - Verb animation display
   - Confirm animations don't overlap or cut off prematurely

## Edge Cases

4. **Recipe Variation Tests**
   - Test with different recipes having varied numbers of final ingredients:
     - 2 final ingredients
     - 3 final ingredients
     - 4 or more final ingredients
   - Verify the sequence works correctly regardless of ingredient count

5. **Vessel Position Tests**
   - Test with vessels in different screen positions:
     - Vessels far apart
     - Vessels already close together
     - Vessels in asymmetric arrangement
   - Verify movement animations properly converge to center

6. **Performance Test**
   - Monitor frame rate during the sequence, especially during:
     - Multiple vessel shaking
     - Simultaneous vessel movement
     - Particle effects
   - Verify smooth performance on various devices

## Visual Quality Tests

7. **Shake Animation Quality Test**
   - Verify shake animation is clearly visible
   - Confirm intensity is appropriate (noticeable but not excessive)
   - Check that all vessels shake simultaneously

8. **Movement Animation Quality Test**
   - Verify smooth movement with proper easing
   - Confirm vessels arrive at center at approximately the same time
   - Check that movement speed is appropriate (not too fast or slow)

9. **Final Effects Quality Test**
   - Verify particle effects are visually appealing
   - Confirm final verb animation is properly centered
   - Check overall visual impact of the sequence

## Interruption and Recovery Tests

10. **Interruption Tests**
    - Attempt to interact during the sequence (clicks, drags)
    - Try refreshing the page during different phases
    - Verify proper disabling of user interaction
    - Confirm the game recovers properly if interrupted

## Integration Tests

11. **Game State Test**
    - Verify final game state is correct after sequence
    - Confirm score calculation includes the auto-combined steps
    - Check that move history correctly reflects the sequence

## Documentation

12. **Documentation Review**
    - Confirm update notes accurately describe the feature
    - Verify that credit and timestamps are included properly
    - Check that comments in code explain the purpose of each sequence phase
