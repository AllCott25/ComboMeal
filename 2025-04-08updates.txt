COMBOMEAL UPDATES - April 8, 2025 (13:51 EDT) - APlasker

ENHANCEMENTS & FIXES:

- Fixed verb animation system to prioritize showing verb animations over combine animations for completed combinations
- Modified animation timing to ensure verb animations are more visible and last longer on screen
- Added additional console logs to help debug animation sequence and visibility
- Made explicit verb animations appear immediately upon successful combinations instead of waiting
- Added clear verb fallbacks ("Mix" for intermediate combinations, "Prepare" for final combinations)
- Fixed potential race condition where combine animations could override verb animations
- Extended verb animation duration by 50% to improve visibility and readability
- Added progress tracking for verb animations to help with debugging
- Fixed default vessel verbDisplayTime to prevent accidental triggering
- Fixed color error in verb animation text that was causing the game to freeze
- Fixed cloud shape irregularity on the right side of the verb animation by increasing point count and improving consistency
- Extended the pulse animation hold time for completed combinations from 300ms to 500ms for better visibility
- Corrected the yellow vessel color to properly use COLORS.vesselYellow for partial combinations
- Fixed color mapping in Vessel constructor to ensure consistent color usage throughout the game

DRAMATIC ANIMATION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Completely redesigned the verb animation sequence for maximum dramatic effect
- Vessels now initially appear without their name displayed
- Verb animation begins at vessel's center and moves halfway to center screen (not all the way)
- Animation begins at 75% of vessel size rather than starting from zero
- Increased the cloud opacity by 20% for better visibility
- Growth phase is 25% faster and fadeout phase 50% faster for better pacing
- Animation now fades out quickly rather than shrinking at the end
- Vessel name only appears after the verb animation reaches its peak 
- Creates a polished theatrical sequence: vessel appears â†’ dramatic verb â†’ name revealed

These changes make the verb animations much more prominent when vessels are successfully combined, 
enhancing the visual feedback when players complete combinations correctly.

### ðŸ†• Added Dynamic Byline Feature

A new dynamic byline has been added underneath the "COMBO MEAL" title to provide helpful guidance to players during gameplay. This feature:

1. Shows a default message of "Drag & drop to combine ingredients!" during normal gameplay.
2. Changes to "Stuck? Use a Hint!" when:
   - The player makes an unsuccessful move (drops a vessel in an invalid location)
   - 15 seconds of inactivity is detected

The "Stuck? Use a Hint!" message will display for 5 seconds before reverting back to the default message. This subtle UI improvement helps guide new players when they get stuck without disrupting the core gameplay experience.

### âœ¨ Enhancements to Byline (14:45 EDT)

The byline feature has been improved with the following enhancements:

1. **Game Screen Only**: The byline now only appears during active gameplay, not on the tutorial or win screens
2. **Visual Consistency**: Styling now matches the tutorial text with bold formatting for better readability
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Added a smooth fade transition effect when byline messages change

These enhancements make the feature more polished and integrated with the existing visual design of the game.

### ðŸ”§ Improved Byline Transitions (15:37 EDT)

The byline transition system has been completely reworked to provide a more reliable and visually pleasing experience:

1. **Sequential Transitions**: Implemented a clear sequence of:
   - Fade out completely
   - Change the message text
   - Fade in with new message
   
2. **Interruption Prevention**: Added guards to prevent multiple transitions from overlapping or interrupting each other

3. **Smoother Animation**: Refined the fade timing for a more polished look (0.25 seconds for each transition phase)

This update addresses the random fade issues in the previous implementation by using a more predictable state machine approach.

### How to Test:
1. Start a new game
2. Wait for 15 seconds without interacting - the byline should fade to "Stuck? Use a Hint!" with a smooth transition
3. Try combining incompatible ingredients - the byline should change with a fade effect
4. After 5 seconds, the byline should fade back to the default message
5. Verify the byline only appears during gameplay, not on the tutorial screen
6. Verify that transitions are sequential (fade out â†’ change â†’ fade in) and don't overlap

No impact to grid placement, gameplay mechanics, or vessel interaction.
