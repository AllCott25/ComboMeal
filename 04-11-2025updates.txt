## Changes Implemented

1. **Merged Animation States**
   - Combined the separate SHAKE and MOVE states into a single ANIMATE state
   - Vessels now shake and move toward the center simultaneously
   - Eliminated all delays between animation phases for seamless transitions

2. **Earlier Animation Trigger**
   - Modified the animation to begin at 50% of verb animation progress (middle point)
   - Previously animations started at 70% (fade-out phase)
   - This makes the sequence start approximately 0.5 seconds earlier

3. **Streamlined State Machine**
   - Removed the now-unnecessary COMPLETED state
   - Simplified the state machine from 5 states to 4 states (WAITING → PENULTIMATE → ANIMATE → COMBINING)
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging and verification

4. **Improved Visual Synchronization**
   - The shake and movement animations now run in parallel, creating a more dramatic effect
   - Final verb animation triggers immediately when vessels reach center
   - The entire sequence flows without interruption or pauses

## Testing Instructions

To test these changes:
1. Play through a recipe until only the final recipe components remain
2. Watch the auto-combination sequence and verify:
   - Vessels begin shaking and moving toward center simultaneously
   - This animation starts during (not after) the verb animation
   - Final verb appears immediately when vessels reach center
   - The entire sequence flows smoothly without pauses

The sequence should now have optimal timing and dramatic visual impact with simultaneous animations.
