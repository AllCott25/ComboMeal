COMBO MEAL - Updates (April 11, 2025)
Time: 16:18 EDT
Developer: APlasker

Changes:
- Modified vessel drawing order to ensure dragged vessels always appear on top of other vessels
- Added code to prioritize the currently dragged vessel in the rendering stack
- Improved user experience by preventing other elements from overlapping dragged vessels
- Enhanced the drawing system to render dragged vessels after all UI elements (counters, buttons, help icon)
- Implemented a secondary drawing pass for dragged vessels to ensure they're always the top-most element

Testing:
- To verify the changes, try dragging vessels over other vessels and UI elements
- The dragged vessel should always appear on top with no overlapping elements
- Check that the vessel appears above counters, the hint button, and the help icon
- Both mouse and touch interactions should work the same way
