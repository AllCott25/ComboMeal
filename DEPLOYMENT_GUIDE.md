## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Your game working locally (which you already do!)
- ‚úÖ A Supabase account with your project set up
- ‚úÖ Your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from your .env file
- üìù You'll need to create:
  - A GitHub account (free)
  - A Cloudflare account (free)
  - A domain name (optional, but recommended - costs ~$10-15/year)

---

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub

GitHub is where your game code will live online. Think of it as Google Drive for code.

### Create a GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" in the top right
3. Choose:
   - Username: Something professional (e.g., `alecplasker`)
   - Email: Your email address
   - Password: Make it strong!
4. Verify your email address

### Create a New Repository
1. Once logged in, click the green "New" button or the "+" icon ‚Üí "New repository"
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `combo-meal` (or any name you like)
   - **Description**: "Daily recipe puzzle game"
   - **Public/Private**: Choose "Public" (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize with README**: Leave unchecked (we already have files)
3. Click "Create repository"
4. **IMPORTANT**: Keep this page open - you'll need the instructions shown!

---

## Step 2: Upload Your Game to GitHub

Now we'll upload your game files to GitHub.

### Method A: Using GitHub Desktop (Easier for Beginners)

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**
   - Go to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
   - Download and install for your operating system

2. **Sign in to GitHub Desktop**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Sign in with your GitHub account

3. **Add Your Game Folder**
   - Click "Add" ‚Üí "Add Existing Repository"
   - If it says "This directory does not appear to be a Git repository", click "Create a Repository" instead
   - Browse to your `ComboMeal-main` folder
   - Click "Add Repository" or "Create Repository"

4. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Click "Publish repository" in the top bar
   - Make sure "Keep this code private" is UNCHECKED
   - Repository name should match what you created on GitHub
   - Click "Publish Repository"

5. **Your files are now on GitHub!**

### Method B: Using Terminal (If you're comfortable with command line)

1. Open Terminal in your `ComboMeal-main` folder
2. Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# If you haven't initialized git yet
git init

# Add all your files
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of Combo Meal game"

# Connect to your GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/combo-meal.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages will host your game for free!

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
   - Navigate to `github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/combo-meal`

2. **Open Settings**
   - Click the "Settings" tab (it's in the repository navigation bar)

3. **Find GitHub Pages settings**
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

4. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select "main" (or "master" if that's what you have)
   - **Folder**: Select "/ (root)"
   - Click "Save"

5. **Wait for deployment**
   - GitHub will show a message: "Your site is live at `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/combo-meal/`"
   - This can take 5-10 minutes the first time
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

6. **Test your game**
   - Visit `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/combo-meal/`
   - Your game should load, but might not work properly yet (we need to set up environment variables)

---

## Step 4: Set Up Cloudflare

Cloudflare will help us:
- Secure your environment variables
- Make your game faster
- Optionally use a custom domain

### Create a Cloudflare Account
1. Go to [cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Create your account with email and password
4. Verify your email

### Option A: Using Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Cloudflare Pages project**
   - From your Cloudflare dashboard, go to "Workers & Pages"
   - Click "Create application" ‚Üí "Pages" ‚Üí "Connect to Git"

2. **Connect your GitHub account**
   - Click "Connect GitHub"
   - Authorize Cloudflare to access your repositories
   - Select your `combo-meal` repository

3. **Configure build settings**
   - **Project name**: `combo-meal` (or any name)
   - **Production branch**: `main`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `/` (just a forward slash)

4. **Add environment variables**
   - Before clicking "Save and Deploy", click "Environment variables"
   - Add these variables:
     - **Variable name**: `SUPABASE_URL`
     - **Value**: Your Supabase URL (from your .env file)
     - Click "Add variable"
     - **Variable name**: `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - **Value**: Your Supabase anon key (from your .env file)
     - Click "Add variable"

5. **Deploy your site**
   - Click "Save and Deploy"
   - Wait for the build to complete (2-5 minutes)
   - Your site will be available at `combo-meal.pages.dev`

### Option B: Using Your Own Domain (Optional)

If you have your own domain:

1. **Add your domain to Cloudflare**
   - From dashboard, click "Add a site"
   - Enter your domain name
   - Follow the instructions to update your nameservers

2. **Connect domain to your Pages project**
   - Go to your Pages project ‚Üí "Custom domains"
   - Click "Set up a custom domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `playsker.com`)
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

---

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Since we're using Cloudflare Pages, your environment variables should already be set. But let's verify everything is working:

### Update Your Build Script

Make sure your `build.js` file is set up correctly to inject environment variables:

1. Your `build.js` should already handle this (based on your successful local build)
2. Cloudflare will run `npm run build` automatically when you push changes

### Security Check

1. **Never commit .env files to GitHub**
   - Check that `.env` is listed in your `.gitignore` file
   - If not, add it:
     ```
     .env
     .env.local
     ```

2. **Verify your repository**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Make sure you don't see any `.env` file listed
   - If you do, you'll need to remove it from history

---

## Step 6: Final Testing

### Test Your Deployed Game

1. **Visit your Cloudflare Pages URL**
   - Go to `https://YOUR-PROJECT.pages.dev`
   - Or your custom domain if you set one up

2. **Test game functionality**
   - ‚úÖ Can you drag and drop ingredients?
   - ‚úÖ Do recipes combine correctly?
   - ‚úÖ Can you create an account/sign in?
   - ‚úÖ Does your progress save?

3. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Right-click ‚Üí "Inspect" ‚Üí "Console" tab
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Common issues are usually related to environment variables

### Mobile Testing

1. Open your game on your phone
2. Test:
   - Touch/drag functionality
   - Screen sizing
   - Performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Supabase is not defined" or authentication errors
- **Cause**: Environment variables not set correctly
- **Solution**: 
  - Check Cloudflare Pages ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment variables
  - Make sure both `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set
  - Redeploy by pushing a small change to GitHub

#### Game loads but nothing works
- **Cause**: JavaScript errors
- **Solution**:
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Make sure all file paths are correct (case-sensitive!)
  - Verify all JavaScript files are loading

#### "404 Not Found" errors
- **Cause**: Incorrect file paths
- **Solution**:
  - Check that all paths in your HTML use forward slashes `/`
  - Ensure file names match exactly (including capitalization)

#### Changes not appearing
- **Cause**: Caching or deployment delay
- **Solution**:
  - Wait 2-5 minutes for Cloudflare to deploy
  - Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
  - Check Cloudflare Pages dashboard for build status

## Maintenance and Updates

### Making Changes to Your Game

1. **Edit files locally**
   - Make your changes in your local `ComboMeal-main` folder
