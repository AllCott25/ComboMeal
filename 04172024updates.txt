April 17, 2024 - Auto Final Combination Implementation - APlasker

CHANGES MADE:
1. Added automatic final recipe combination sequence
   - When only the final recipe components remain, the game automatically combines them one-by-one
   - Added smooth animations between combinations
   - Added timing delays between combinations for visual clarity
   - Disabled user interaction during the auto-combination sequence

2. Fixed verb animation timing (17:15 EDT update)
   - Ensured each verb animation completes before starting the next combination
   - Prevented overlapping verb animations for clearer presentation
   - Increased delay between combinations to allow proper viewing of each step
   - Added proper verb animations for intermediate combinations

3. Enhanced final recipe combination visuals (17:45 EDT update)
   - Implemented state machine approach for more controlled animation sequence
   - Added dramatic vessel shake effect when final ingredients are ready
   - Created coordinated movement where all vessels move simultaneously to center
   - Added spectacular particle effects during the final combination
   - Improved timing and pacing for a more satisfying conclusion

HOW TO TEST:
1. Play the game normally until only the final recipe components remain
   - For example, in Chicken Parm: get to where you have Fried Chicken Cutlet, Tomato Sauce, and Mixed Cheeses
2. Once you have only the final components, the auto-combination sequence should start automatically
3. Watch the enhanced combination sequence:
   - All vessels will shake to signal the start of the sequence
   - Vessels will move toward the center of the screen simultaneously
   - Once all vessels reach the center, they'll combine with particle effects
   - Final verb animation will appear and transition to win screen
4. Verify that each animation phase completes smoothly before the next begins

NOTES:
- The sequence has a 1-second delay before starting
- The vessels shake for 0.5 seconds with an enhanced shake effect
- All vessels move to the center over 1 second with smooth easing
- Extra particle effects appear during the final combination 
- User interaction is completely disabled during the sequence to prevent interference

TIME: 17:45 EDT
