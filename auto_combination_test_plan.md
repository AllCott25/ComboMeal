# Auto Final Combination Test Plan

## Basic Functionality Tests

1. **Normal Game Flow Test**
   - Play the game normally until you have only the final recipe components (e.g., Fried Chicken Cutlet, Tomato Sauce, and Mixed Cheeses for Chicken Parm)
   - Verify that the auto-combination sequence starts automatically after a brief delay
   - Confirm that vessels combine one by one with appropriate animations
   - Ensure the final verb animation displays correctly
   - Verify the game transitions to the win screen properly

2. **User Interaction Blocking Test**
   - During the auto-combination sequence, try to:
     - Click on vessels
     - Drag vessels
     - Click the hint button
   - Verify that all user interactions are properly blocked

## Edge Cases

3. **Timing Tests**
   - Verify there's a proper delay before the sequence starts (approximately 1 second)
   - Confirm the delay between combinations is appropriate (approximately 2 seconds)
   - Ensure animations play at a reasonable speed and are visible to the user

4. **Sequence Interruption Test**
   - Try refreshing the page during auto-combination
   - Verify the game state is properly reset

5. **Single Vessel Test**
   - Test with a recipe that has only one final ingredient
   - Verify the game correctly identifies this situation and doesn't try to auto-combine

## Visual Quality Tests

6. **Animation Quality Test**
   - Verify that combining animations look smooth and professional
   - Ensure that vessels properly move toward each other
   - Confirm the new vessel appears with appropriate visual effects

7. **Flow Test**
   - Watch the entire sequence multiple times
   - Verify it feels natural and satisfying
   - Ensure the pacing feels appropriate (not too fast or too slow)

## Compatibility Tests

8. **Device Testing**
   - Test on desktop (various window sizes)
   - Test on mobile devices (phone and tablet)
   - Verify the feature works consistently across all devices

9. **Performance Test**
   - Monitor frame rate during the auto-combination sequence
   - Verify there are no performance issues or lag

## Bug and Regression Testing

10. **Integration Test**
    - Verify that other game features still work properly after implementation
    - Check that the win screen functions correctly
    - Confirm score calculation is still accurate

## Documentation

11. **Documentation Verification**
    - Confirm update notes accurately describe the feature
    - Verify that timestamps and credits are included properly
