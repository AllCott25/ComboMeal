ComboMeal Game Updates - 03-24-2025 22:20:34 EDT
Modified by APlasker

SCORING SYSTEM CHANGES:

1. Letter grade calculation is now based ONLY on error count (blackMoves):
   - A: 0 errors
   - B: 1-2 errors
   - C: 3-4 errors
   - X: 5+ errors
   - A+ is now achieved with both 0 errors AND 0 hints

2. Share functionality:
   - Added hint indicators (‚ùì) to the shared score text
   - One ‚ùì emoji is added for each hint used
   - Updated share text format: "Combo Meal üç¥ Recipe [number]: [grade emojis] [hint emojis] [egg emoji]"

These changes make the scoring system more forgiving by separating errors from hint usage while still encouraging players to solve puzzles without hints for the highest score. 

BUG FIXES (03-24-2025 22:40 EDT):

1. Fixed ReferenceError in shareScore function:
   - The function now calculates hint count locally instead of relying on an external variable
   - This resolves the "Can't find variable: redHintMoves" error when sharing scores

2. Improved error message:
   - Updated the error alert message to be more friendly
   - New message: "Whoops! Something's broken. Let me know and I'll fix it ‚úåÔ∏è" 

ADDITIONAL FIXES (03-24-2025 22:42 EDT):

3. Fixed missing hint indicators in share text:
   - Now using the global hintCount variable directly instead of recounting from moveHistory
   - This ensures the share text ‚ùì emoji count matches the visual indicators on the letter score
