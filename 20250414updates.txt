Updated by APlasker

## Changes Made

1. Modified the `drawTopBottomFlowers()` function to place flowers at the very top and bottom edges of the screen when in mobile/narrow view:
   - Changed flower positioning from relative to play area to fixed edge positioning
   - Flowers now appear in single rows at the top and bottom edges with minimal spacing
   - Added safety checks to prevent overlap with the play area
   - Reduced the safety margin for more consistent edge placement
   - Maintained the existing color patterns and flower sizes

## Technical Details

- Changed from variable distance calculations to fixed positioning at screen edges
- Top row is positioned at `smallerPetalSize * 1.5` from the top
- Bottom row is positioned at `windowHeight - (smallerPetalSize * 1.5)` from the bottom
- Added safety checks to ensure flowers don't overlap with the play area content
- No changes to the desktop view flower patterns

## Testing Instructions

1. View the game on a narrow screen or mobile device where side flowers don't appear
2. Verify that a single row of flowers appears at the very top of the screen
3. Verify that a single row of flowers appears at the very bottom of the screen
4. Try different screen sizes to ensure the flowers remain visible without overlapping game elements
5. Rotate device to ensure the pattern adjusts properly in both orientations
