# Super Easy Playtest Tool - Cook Button Fix

## Issue
The Cook button was not responding to clicks in the playtest environment.

## Root Causes

1. **Game State Check**: The `startGame` function was checking if `vessels.length === 0 || isLoadingRecipe` and returning early, preventing the game from starting.

2. **Wallpaper Animation**: The game was trying to start a wallpaper animation transition that doesn't exist in playtest mode.

3. **Mouse Position Updates**: The p5.js instance wasn't properly updating global mouse position variables that the button click detection relies on.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Override startGame Function
Added a custom `startGame` function for playtest mode that:
- Bypasses the vessel and loading checks
- Sets `isLoadingRecipe = false` to ensure the game isn't stuck in loading state
- Disables wallpaper animation
- Calls `actuallyStartGame()` directly

### 2. Initialize Game State
Set up proper initial game state variables:
- `gameStarted = false`
- `gameWon = false`
- `isLoadingRecipe = false`
- `wallpaperAnimation = null`
- `wallpaperAnimationActive = false`

### 3. Mouse Position Updates
Enhanced the p5.js event handlers to properly update global mouse position:
- Added mouse position updates in `mousePressed` and `mouseReleased` handlers
- Added continuous updates in the `draw` loop
- Ensured `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `pmouseX`, `pmouseY`, and `mouseIsPressed` are always current

## Result

The Cook button should now:
1. ✅ Properly detect mouse clicks
2. ✅ Start the game immediately without wallpaper animations
3. ✅ Bypass loading state checks that could block game start
4. ✅ Work consistently in the playtest environment

## Testing

Click the Cook button and verify:
1. The button responds to hover (visual feedback)
2. Clicking starts the game immediately
3. Vessels become draggable after clicking Cook
4. No errors appear in the console
