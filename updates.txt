**Request:** Fix the hint vessel positioning to prevent overlap with ingredient vessels.
**Solution:**
- Adjusted the hint vessel's vertical position to be closer to the hint button

- Removed the numerical counter from the move history, keeping only the visual circles
- Completely redesigned the tutorial screen with three clear "equations" showing game mechanics
- Created a new "How to play:" header at the top of the tutorial
- Implemented three visual equations showing ingredient combinations:
  1. "Grapes" + "Sugar" = "Jelly" (showing basic ingredients combining to make a complete combination)
  2. "Jelly" + "Peanut Butter" = "Jelly + Peanut Butter" (showing partial combinations turning yellow)
  3. "Jelly + Peanut Butter" + "Potato Bread" = "PB&J Sandwich" (showing the final recipe solution)
- Added descriptive text under each equation explaining the game mechanics
