# Super Easy Playtest Tool - Final Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. lerpColor is not defined Error
**Problem**: The p5.js `lerpColor` function wasn't being exposed to the global scope, causing errors when Button class tried to use it for hover effects.

**Solution**: Added `lerpColor` and other color-related functions to the list of exposed p5 functions:
- `lerpColor` - for color interpolation
- `red`, `green`, `blue`, `alpha` - color component extraction
- `hue`, `saturation`, `brightness` - HSB color components
- `colorMode`, `RGB`, `HSB`, `HSL` - color mode functions

### 2. Vessels Array Being Reset
**Problem**: When clicking the Cook button, vessels were being cleared somewhere in the game initialization, preventing the game from starting.

**Solution**: 
- Created a backup of vessels before game start
- Override `actuallyStartGame` to preserve vessels
- Restore vessels if they get cleared during initialization
- Also preserve `displayedVessels` array

### 3. Enhanced Button Class Fallback
**Problem**: The basic Button class fallback wasn't complete enough for the game's needs.

**Solution**: Added proper methods to the fallback Button class:
- `isInside()` - for click detection
- `handleClick()` - for click handling
- `checkHover()` - for hover state
- Basic drawing functionality
- Proper hover state tracking

## Current Status

The playtest tool should now:
1. ✅ Display the title screen properly
2. ✅ Handle all p5.js color functions
3. ✅ Preserve vessels when starting the game
4. ✅ Allow clicking the Cook button to start gameplay
5. ✅ Enable dragging ingredients after game starts

## Next Steps

Try the playtest again and you should be able to:
1. See the full title screen with recipe name
2. Click the Cook button without errors
3. Start dragging ingredients to create combinations
4. Test the full recipe gameplay

If any issues remain, they're likely related to:
- Asset loading (images, sounds)
- Specific game mechanics
- Win condition detection
