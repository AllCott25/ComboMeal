VESSEL UNIFICATION UPDATES:

1. Unified the implementation of red (#FF5252/COLORS.vesselHint) and yellow vessels
   across the codebase. Red vessels now share exactly the same shape as yellow vessels,
   with color being the only difference.

2. Changes implemented:
   - Updated Vessel.draw() method to use a single condition for both red and yellow vessels
   - Updated drawTutorialVessel() function to handle red vessels identically to yellow
   - Updated drawHelpVessel() function in help.js to apply the same unification

3. Benefits:
   - Simplified code by removing duplicate logic
   - Improved consistency in visual appearance
   - Reduced risk of bugs by centralizing vessel shape logic
   - Made future vessel shape changes easier to implement and maintain

4. No functional changes to game mechanics - this is purely a code simplification
   and visual consistency improvement.

This update completes the unification of vessel shapes across the game while
maintaining the distinct color coding for different vessel types.

FOLLOW-UP FIX (22:38 EDT):
- Fixed an issue where tutorial vessels were not displaying due to a duplicate
  drawTutorialVessel function definition at the end of sketch.js
- Removed the duplicate function and kept a renamed version (drawSimpleTutorialVessel)
  for potential future use
- Tutorial vessels now display correctly on the start screen
