ERROR MESSAGE SYSTEM ANALYSIS:

1. Current Implementation:
   - Error messages are stored in arrays in both js/byline.js and js/sketch.js
   - Messages include phrases like "Sounds tasty, but not quite right" and "Need a peek at the recipe? Try a hint!"
   - The system tracks used messages to avoid repetition
   - Different messages are shown for first errors versus subsequent errors
   - Implementation uses the showRandomErrorMessage() function to manage display logic

2. Key Features:
   - Randomization of messages to provide variety to users
   - State tracking with variables like firstErrorOccurred and usedErrorMessages
   - Transition effects when displaying new messages via updateBylineWithTransition
   - Reset mechanism when all messages have been displayed

3. Files Containing Error Message Logic:
   - js/byline.js: Contains core error message array and display logic
   - js/sketch.js: Contains similar implementation, likely for integration with game mechanics

BUG FIX - HELP MODAL TEXT ERROR:

1. Issue Fixed:
   - Fixed "Uncaught ReferenceError: totalHeight is not defined" error in help.js
   - Error occurred when text() function was called with incorrect parameters in drawHelpVessel function

2. Solution:
   - Modified text() function calls in drawHelpVessel to use correct parameter signature
   - Removed the unnecessary height parameter when drawing text which was causing the error
   - Maintained the same visual appearance of text in the help modal

3. Testing:
   - To verify the fix, open the help modal by clicking the help icon during gameplay
   - Confirm that all vessel text displays correctly without console errors

This analysis provides a foundation for any future modifications or enhancements to the error messaging system.
