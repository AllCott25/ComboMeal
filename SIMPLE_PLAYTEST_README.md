# Simple Playtest Solution

## Overview

This is the simplest, most elegant solution for the playtest feature. It uses URL parameters to specify which date's recipe to load, making it easy to share direct links to specific playtests.

## How It Works

1. **Direct URL Access**: Access any recipe by date using: `/simple-playtest.html?date=YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Example: `/simple-playtest.html?date=2025-04-11`

2. **Admin Integration**: The `playtest-links.html` page provides:
   - A list of all available recipes with quick test links
   - A custom link generator for any date
   - Click-to-copy functionality for easy sharing

## Files Created

- `simple-playtest.html` - The main playtest page
- `js/simple-playtest.js` - JavaScript that reads the date parameter and loads the appropriate recipe
- `playtest-links.html` - Admin tool for generating playtest links

## Key Features

- **URL-based**: Each date has its own URL, perfect for direct linking
- **Simple**: No complex UI or date selection needed
- **Professional**: Clean loading screen with error handling
- **Shareable**: Easy to share specific playtest links with others
- **Admin-friendly**: Quick access to test any recipe from the admin space

## Usage Examples

1. **Direct Access**: 
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/simple-playtest.html?date=2025-04-11
   ```

2. **From Admin** (includes back link):
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/simple-playtest.html?date=2025-04-11&admin=true
   ```

3. **Link Generator**:
   Visit `/playtest-links.html` to:
   - See all available recipes
   - Generate custom links for any date
   - Copy links with one click

```
