VESSEL STYLING CONSISTENCY UPDATES:

1. Modified all vessel outlines (stroke width) to use screen height as a reference 
   instead of vessel dimensions. This ensures consistent outline thickness across
   all vessel types regardless of their individual sizes.
   - Set stroke width to 0.25% of screen height with a minimum of 2px

2. Modified all vessel text fonts to use screen height as a reference instead of 
   vessel dimensions. This ensures consistent font sizes across all vessel types.
   - Set font size to 1.5% of screen height with a minimum of 10px

3. Applied these changes to:
   - Regular game vessels (basic and advanced)
   - Hint vessels
   - Tutorial vessels
   - Help modal vessels

4. Reduced vessel scaling during dragging from 1.1x to 1.05x to prevent text 
   from becoming too large and creating unwanted line breaks while still providing
   visual feedback that the vessel is being dragged.
   - Updated both mouse and touch handlers

5. Implemented separate scaling for vessel body and text to allow for more refined
   visual feedback:
   - Added new bodyScale and textScale properties to vessels
   - When dragging, the vessel body scales to 105% while text only scales to 102.5%
   - When pulsing (after successful combinations), the vessel body scales to 120% 
     while text only scales to 110%
   - This helps prevent text from becoming too large and creating unwanted line breaks

This update enhances visual consistency and makes the game look more polished 
with equal styling between base and advanced vessels.
