ENHANCEMENT: Improved Vessel Position Inheritance - APlasker (April 11, 2025 - 16:36)

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Enhanced position inheritance in vessel combination code:
   - Modified combineVessels function to set better position information for new vessels
   - New vessels now inherit position based on average position of both parent vessels
   - Added isNewlyCombined property to track newly created vessels

2. Added persistence to position preferences:
   - Enhanced arrangeVessels function to prioritize newly combined vessels
   - Prevented immediate clearing of position preferences for newly created vessels
   - Position preferences now persist through multiple arrangement cycles for new vessels
   - Added special handling for hint-generated vessels

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- When two vessels are combined, the resulting partial combination will appear in the same row
- Vessels should now maintain their row position more consistently after combinations
- Hint button clicks should cause less disruption to vessel arrangement

TEST METHODS:
- Combine two vessels from the same row - verify the new vessel appears in that row
- Create multiple combinations in quick succession - verify position stability
- Use the hint button and verify that surrounding vessels maintain their positions

These changes should significantly improve the position predictability of vessels after combinations.

ENHANCEMENT: Advanced Position Persistence System - APlasker (April 11, 2025 - 16:48)

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Added Comprehensive Position Tracking:
   - Added new vessel properties: positionStrength, homeRow, homeColumn, positionHistory
   - Vessels now track how many turns they've spent in a specific position
   - After 3 turns in the same position, vessels establish a "home" position

2. Implemented Gradual Position Preference Decay:
   - Position preferences now have a "strength" value (0-1)
   - Newly created/positioned vessels start with maximum strength (1.0)
   - Strength decays gradually with each turn (10-20% per turn)
   - Preferences are only cleared when strength falls below 0.2

3. Enhanced Position Prioritization:
   - Added a priority system that considers multiple factors:
     * Newly combined vessels have highest priority
     * Higher position strength gives higher priority
     * Vessels with longer position history get higher priority
   - Vessels try to retain their home positions when moved slightly

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Vessels should maintain their positions over multiple turns/combinations
- The more time a vessel spends in a position, the more likely it is to stay there
- When dragging vessels, they'll prefer to return to established positions if dropped nearby
- Position stability should be maintained even after several sequential combinations

TEST METHODS:
- Create several combinations in sequence and verify position stability across turns
- Drag a vessel that's been in position for several turns, then drop it nearby - it should return to its original position
- Combine vessels in different parts of the play area and verify overall grid stability

These enhancements create a much more stable and predictable vessel placement system while still allowing flexibility in the overall layout.
