# Super Easy Playtest Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Hamburger Menu Infinite Loop**: The menu.js was repeatedly trying to initialize (297+ times) because dependencies weren't available
2. **Game State Not Updating**: `gameStarted` remained false even after initialization
3. **Loading State Issues**: `loadingComplete` was being reset by `actuallyStartGame`
4. **SVG Loading Error**: Non-critical wallpaper animation error

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Early Dependency Initialization (Lines 10-75)
- Moved COLORS and Button class definitions to the top of supereasyplaytest.js
- These are now available immediately when the script loads, preventing dependency issues

### 2. Hamburger Menu Loop Prevention (Lines 370-402)
- Added initialization attempt counter
- Limited attempts to 5 before stopping
- Added proper logging for debugging
- Override happens early in `loadGameWithRecipe`

### 3. Game State Management (Lines 785-802)
- Removed complex `actuallyStartGame` override
- Call it directly and manage state afterwards
- Ensure `loadingComplete` stays true in playtest mode
- Added comprehensive logging after game start

### 4. Additional Safeguards
- Check if game is already started before reinitializing
- Proper vessel preservation during game start
- Clear wallpaper animation variables

## Testing Instructions

1. Open `supereasyplaytest.html`
2. Select a recipe
3. Click "Start Playtest"
4. The game should now start properly without getting stuck

## Debug Tool

Created `test-supereasyplaytest.html` for debugging:
- Tests global dependencies
- Checks game initialization state
- Allows manual triggering of startGame
- Shows real-time console output

## What to Look For

When the game works correctly:
- Hamburger menu initializes once (not 297 times)
- `gameStarted` becomes true after clicking Cook!
- Vessels are created and visible
- No infinite loops in console

## If Issues Persist

1. Open the debug tool alongside the playtest
2. Use "Test Global Dependencies" to check what's missing
3. Use "Test Start Game" to manually trigger game start
4. Check console output for specific errors

The main issue was the hamburger menu getting stuck in an infinite initialization loop because its dependencies weren't available early enough. This has been fixed by initializing those dependencies at the top of the script.
