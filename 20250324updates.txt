ComboMeal5 Color Updates - March 24, 2025 12:50 PM EDT
Updated by APlasker

CHANGES:
- Further standardized color usage for green vessels to fix inconsistent colors
- Fixed direct string assignment of 'green' to use COLORS.green consistently
- Simplified complex green color checks in multiple parts of the code
- Consolidated moveHistory code to use COLORS.green for all green vessel types

This update further standardizes the use of the avocado green color (#778F5D) throughout the game. The previous updates had already replaced most instances, but this update addresses additional edge cases where string literals and mixed color references were causing inconsistent rendering.

All vessels using any green color reference should now consistently use the avocado green color defined in COLORS.green.
