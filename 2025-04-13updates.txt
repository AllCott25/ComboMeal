CM11 Updates - 2025-04-13 22:33:24
Implemented by: APlasker

Changes Made:
1. Updated the mouseReleased function in js/sketch.js to use COLORS constants instead of hardcoded color strings
2. Added drawTutorialVessel function that uses COLORS constants for consistent color handling

These changes improve code consistency by replacing all hardcoded color values with references 
to the COLORS constants. The functionality remains identical, but the code is now more maintainable
and easier to update if color schemes change in the future.

Testing:
1. Test that vessel color combinations work correctly
2. Verify that the easter egg functionality still works when using yellow vessels
3. Confirm that tutorial vessels display with the correct colors and outlines
